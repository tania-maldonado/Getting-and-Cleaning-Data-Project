Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
=================================
The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The input needed to execute run_analisys.R represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S
smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

And here are the data for the project:

To run run_analisys.R you need to follow steps:

* Download the zip file and Unzip in your working directory ( the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder contains all files).
* Execute run_analysis.R in your working directory ("tidyDataSet.txt" file is created in your working directory).
